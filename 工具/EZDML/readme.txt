EZDML V2.01 (Freeware)

EZDML is a small tool which helps you to create data models quickly. It's simple and fast, with EZDML you can create a table within few seconds.

Features:
1.Table model design: create table, fields, primary key, foreign key and comments
2.Text script to create models quickly
3.Diagram layout with logical and physical model views
4.Import exists tables from database (oralce, sqlserver and ODBC)
5.Generate database DDL sql, compare with exists object to genarate proper SQL
6.Generate simple codes: C++, Pascal, c#, java


Usage:
1. The programe will automatically load the last model file on start
2. In the diagram, you may following function keys: + zoom in, - zoom out, R restore, F fit selection (or all), Left/Right/Up/Down for direction
3. In the text script editor, you can use simple letter to present data types: S, I, F, D, BO, E, BL, O (String, Integer, Float, DateTime, Boolean, Enum, Blob, Object), default is String.

For example:

TestTable
--------
ID  PK
RID FK
Title S(200)
ItemCount I
ItemPrice F(10,2)
OrderDate D
Desc Describ
TpNa TypeName
Memo

4. Foreign keys can be added and displayed in the diagram
5. Importing and exporting to ORACLE, SQLSERVER and ODBC supported
6. Without database connection, you can also generate DDL SQL for creation only; only when connected will the generation make compared SQL
7. To avoid data loss, the programe will still generate SQL to Drop objects, but these SQLs will be marked as comments
8. This soft is free for any use. The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the use of the Software. The user must assume the entire risk of using the Software.
